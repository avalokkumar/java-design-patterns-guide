## Facade design pattern
The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, interfaces, and objects. It aims to provide a higher-level interface that makes the system easier to use by hiding the complexities of the underlying system.

The Facade design pattern is useful when a system is very complex, and its internal structure is hard to understand, making it difficult to use. By providing a simplified interface, the Facade design pattern allows developers to use the system without having to understand its internal details.

### Use cases for the Facade pattern include:

* Providing a simple interface to a complex system - As mentioned earlier, the Facade pattern is ideal for simplifying a complex system by providing a simplified interface to it.

* Decoupling the client code from the subsystem - The Facade pattern can be used to decouple client code from the subsystem, which allows changes to be made to the subsystem without affecting the client code.

* Simplifying development by dividing responsibility - When working on a large system with many different components, the Facade pattern can help to divide responsibility between developers, making the development process more manageable.

* Wrapping an existing system - The Facade pattern can also be used to wrap an existing system, providing a simpler interface to the existing system while keeping its internal structure intact.

> In summary, the Facade pattern simplifies the complexity of a system by providing a simplified interface to it, making it easier to use and understand. It can be used to decouple client code from the subsystem, simplify development, and wrap an existing system.

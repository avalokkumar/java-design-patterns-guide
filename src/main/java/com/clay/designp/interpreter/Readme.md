## What is the Interpreter Pattern?

The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a way to interpret or evaluate a language grammar or expression. It allows you to define a language or a syntax, and then provides a way to evaluate sentences or expressions written in that language.

In this pattern, an abstract syntax tree (AST) is constructed from a language's grammar, and an interpreter is used to evaluate the AST. The interpreter traverses the AST and performs an action based on each node in the tree.

## The Interpreter pattern is typically used in cases where:

* A language needs to be defined and interpreted
* The grammar of the language is well-defined and unlikely to change
* The number of sentences or expressions to be evaluated is relatively small

## This pattern can be useful in situations such as:

* Parsing expressions in a programming language
* Implementing search queries in a search engine
* Interpreting mathematical expressions or formulas
* Parsing and executing configuration files

# Design Patterns in Java
This repository provides code examples for various design patterns in Java.

## Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows a chain of objects to handle a request. It is often used when there are multiple objects that can handle a request and the specific object to handle the request is unknown.

### Use Cases

Some common use cases for the Chain of Responsibility pattern include:
* Request filtering or validation
* Authentication and authorization
* Logging and error handling

### Example
> An example of using the Chain of Responsibility pattern could be a technical support system. The system could have multiple levels of support handlers, each responsible for handling a specific type of ticket. If a support handler cannot handle a ticket, it passes the ticket to the next handler in the chain until the ticket is either resolved or there are no more handlers.

## Command
The Command design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to encapsulate a request. It separates the object that issues the command from the object that receives and executes the command. This decoupling allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in a system.

### Use Cases
Some common use cases for the Command pattern include:

* Implementing undo and redo functionality
* Implementing a queue of requests
* Implementing a macro recording and playback system

### Example
> An example of using the Command pattern could be a remote control system for a home entertainment system. Each button on the remote control could be associated with a command object, which encapsulates a specific action to be taken (e.g. turning the TV on/off, changing the channel, etc.). When a button is pressed, the associated command object is executed.

## Interpreter
The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It is often used to implement DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) or to interpret user input.

### Use Cases
Some common use cases for the Interpreter pattern include:

* Implementing a calculator or math expression evaluator
* Implementing a search query language
* Implementing a configuration language for a system

### Example
> An example of using the Interpreter pattern could be a simple calculator. The calculator could take a string of arithmetic expressions as input, parse the expressions into a syntax tree, and then evaluate the expressions based on the syntax tree. The Interpreter pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to handle various expressions and operators.
